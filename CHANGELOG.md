## [Unreleased]

## [2.10.2]

## [2.10.1]
### Added

### Changed
- 'abrt-ccpp.service' is not enabled by default.
'abrt-abrt-journal-core.service' is enablen instead. ABRT gets coredumps from
systemd journal.
- Modify suspicious kernel string "invalid opcode:" because "invalid opcode:"
can also be without colon.
- The EVENTs generating machine-id and executing sosreport are now delivered as
standalone plugins.
- Remove dependency on hawkey. Function hy_split_nevra of obsolete hawkey
library replaced by own implementation, as hawkey will be removed soon.

### Fixed
- Fix calling of 'run_event_on_problem_dir'. The function is imported as a solo
identifier from the report module.
- Fix scratch-build targe. Prefix "dist-" in no longer used in koji build target.


## [2.10.0]
### Added
- Start reporting the detected problems to systemd-journal in the form of
catalogue messages that contains essential problem details. The messages are
reported with SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=abrt-notification and are mainly designated for
developers and administrator.
- Start capturing /proc/[pid]/ns details and some other interesting process
details for uncaught Python, Ruby and Java exceptions in the problem data.
- Run the core dump time backtrace generator under the user of the crashed
process and not under root. This change makes ABRT more secure to deploy as
ABRT no longer runs elfutils functions in superuser context.
- Set up the yum/dnf debuginfo repositories according to /etc/os-release
captured in the problem details, so it is possible to analyze core dump files
of processes running in a container or a changed root environment.
- Save core dump files to disk using low level kernel functions to make the
dumping a little bit faster.
- Start limiting the dumped core file size and set the default limit to 5GiB.
The limit can be changed through the MaxCoreFileSize configuration option in
the /etc/abrt/plugins/CCpp.conf file.
- Give the Kernel vmcore plugin the ability to parse the kdump.conf file at any
location, so the plugin can be used from a container.

### Changed
- Move the look for Bodhi updates including know Bugzilla bugs to a solo event
to allow users of non-Fedora distributions to run the core dump analysis tools
without error messages about unavailability of Bodhi.
- Start notifying all detected problems and not only those that are related to
a package.
- Update the list of known interpreters with python3.6.

### Fixed
- Ensure that the reporting will not be terminated with the 'the problem cannot
be reported' error message when a user passes the '--unsafe' argument on
command line.
- Start considering child processes of the processes that run binaries with the
path prefix '/usr/libexec/docker' containerized by Docker.
- Correct a typo in a name of a variable causing the absence of DSO list
(Dynamic Shared Objec list) in the captured problem details.
- Enable usage of the problem Python API in GObject projects by proper includes
from gi.repository.
- Make sure all users can run `abrt report` on their problems and the process
does not exit with file access permission error.
- Fix the bugs preventing users from passing their preferred format of problem
data to `abrt list --fmt` and `abrt info --fmt`.
- Fix several file descriptor leaks in abrtd.
